Le code n'est fonctionnel qu'en mettant un nouveau token OAuth.

We noticed that a valid OAuth access token of yours was committed to a GitHub repository. Disclosing a valid access token would allow other people to interact with GitHub on your behalf, potentially altering data, your contact information, and billing data.

As a precautionary measure, we have revoked the OAuth token. A new token will need to be generated in order to continue using OAuth to authenticate to GitHub.
